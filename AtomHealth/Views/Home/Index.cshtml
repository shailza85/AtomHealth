<p style="font-size:18px; line-height:20px; margin-bottom:15px;">
    In today's times when technology evolves everyday, a healthcare provider's responsibility extends way beyond providing care. Collaborative care between different specialists is the norm and access to relevant health information is critical to diagnosis and management. At Atom Health, we collect verified vital health information and store it in a secure encrypted digital health ID or "ATOM" of each patient.


    <h1 style="color:#42a5ff; font-size:24px; font-weight:bold">Our Vision</h1>
    <hr />

<p style="font-size:18px; line-height:20px; margin-bottom:15px;">
    The future of healthcare is a good balance of in-person care and telehealth consults. To make the process seamless, to keep the care uninterrupted and to ensure best possible outcomes, sharing of vital health information in a timely manner is critical. While the physician is the custodian of the medical records, the patient is an aware, responsible citizen who wants to actively participate in maintaining his/her health.
</p>
<p style="font-size:18px; line-height:20px; margin-bottom:15px;">
    "Atom" is a unique digital health ID, secure and encrypted, that stores a patient's vital health information, curated with the help of their physician.

@*<p style="font-size:18px; line-height:20px; margin-bottom:15px;">Specific responsibilities vary by specialty, but all doctors need to be able to perform the following duties:</p>
    <div class="listDesign">
        <ul>
            <li>Assess symptoms</li>
            <li>Diagnose conditions</li>
            <li>Prescribe and administer treatment</li>
            <li>Provide follow-up care of patients, refer them to other providers, and interpret their laboratory results</li>
            <li>Prescribe medication</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <p style="font-size:18px; line-height:20px; margin-bottom:15px;">
        Assess symptoms
        Diagnose conditions
        Prescribe and administer treatment
        Provide follow-up care of patients, refer them to other providers, and interpret their laboratory results
        Collaborate with physician assistants, nurse practitioners, registered nurses, and other health professionals
        Prescribe medication
        Stay current on medical technology and research
        Since doctors are responsible for their patients' well-being, this occupation is more demanding than most. In addition to having a comprehensive knowledge of medicine, they need to be able to communicate their findings to patients who typically do not possess the same knowledge. They work with people when they are at their most vulnerable and this requires empathy in addition to the required technical knowledge.
        Beyond the foundational duties and responsibilities of all doctors, each specialty in the field requires doctors to be able to perform tasks specific to those jobs. Surgeons, for example, must have the manual dexterity to perform precise operations and the stamina to spend hours at a time in the operating room.
